Welcome to my digit recognition webpage app! I have built this handwritten digit recognizing model utilizing a
convolutional neural network (CNN) fine tuned with MNIST training data. Server (backend) is built using Python and
supporting tools include Tensorflow and Numpy. Client (frontend) is built using JavaScript and React. Communication 
between server and client is utilized with Flask.
